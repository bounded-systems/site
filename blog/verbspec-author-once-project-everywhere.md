# Author a verb once. Get the CLI, the MCP tool, the OpenAPI route, and the model schema for free.

Ship one capability to both humans and agents today and you write it four times:
a CLI with flag parsing and `--help`, an MCP tool definition, an OpenAPI
operation, and a tool-use schema for Anthropic's models. Four artifacts, four
hand-maintained copies of the same shape — and they drift. The help text says
one thing, its tool schema says a slightly older thing, the OpenAPI spec a
third. Each rots on its own schedule, and nothing tells you when.

The fix is boring and total: there should be **one** definition, and every
surface should be a pure projection of it.

## One spec, four surfaces

That's verbspec. A verb's input and output are **Zod schemas** — the single
source of truth, giving you runtime validation *and* static types from one
definition. `z.toJSONSchema` turns it into the interchange IR, and every surface
is a pure function of that IR:

```
VerbSpec (Zod — canonical)
  └─ z.toJSONSchema ──▶ JSON Schema (the IR)
        ├─ parseArgs / --help   ──▶ a CLI
        ├─ toMcpTool            ──▶ an MCP tool
        ├─ toAnthropicTool      ──▶ a model tool-use schema
        └─ toOpenApiOperation   ──▶ a REST operation
```

You author the verb once:

```ts
const greet = defineVerb({
  id: "greet",
  summary: "Greet someone by name",
  input: z.object({ name: z.string(), loud: z.boolean().default(false) }),
  output: z.object({ message: z.string() }),
  run: ({ name, loud }) => ({ message: loud ? `HELLO ${name}!` : `hello ${name}` }),
});
```

…and the CLI (`greet Ada --loud`), the MCP tool, the model schema, and
`POST /greet` are all just that spec seen from different sides. No codegen and no
build step — and no FFI to author a verb.

## Why it can't drift

The surfaces aren't generated-then-edited; they're **computed from the spec on
demand**. There's nothing to keep in sync because there's only one thing. That's
the whole trick: with a single definition, drift has nothing to occur between.

The package is a clean leaf: its only production dependency is the `zod` peer
dep, and an extractability test enforces that it stays pure — outward-only
imports, no ambient authority (no shelling out, no `process.env`). You can drop
it into anything.

## What it covers

verbspec is the **projection layer** — author once, project everywhere,
drift-free. It handles one job: the "one source of truth projected to many
surfaces" mechanism, pulled out as a standalone, usable thing. The
capability/security story is separate; that's the door work. verbspec is
**MIT**, on npm, with `zod` the only peer dependency. It works today.

If you maintain a CLI *and* an MCP server *and* an OpenAPI spec for the same
operations, this collapses four hand-maintained artifacts into one — and the one
can't lie to the other three.

*This is one mechanism from a larger bet — keeping agent-authored contracts
honest as they multiply (see [the door is the unit of bounded
authority](bifurcation-and-inter-contract-enforcement.html)). verbspec is the
piece with the most pull on its own.*
